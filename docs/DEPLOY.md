# Production deploy — Tutoring Notes

Use this with **[GTM-READINESS.md](./GTM-READINESS.md)** (what "ready" means for pilots vs scale).

## Recommended stack (free tier, zero income)

| Layer | Service | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hosting | **Vercel** (free) | Perfect for Next.js; zero-config deploys from GitHub |
| Database | **Neon** (free tier) | Serverless Postgres; 0.5 GB storage, scales to zero |
| Email | **Resend** (free tier) | 3 000 emails/month free; simple SMTP relay |

---

## Required environment variables

| Variable | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon **pooled** connection string (use for queries in serverless) |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Neon **direct** (unpooled) connection string (required for migrations) |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Long random string; unique per environment |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Public origin, e.g. `https://notes.example.com` — required for reset links + OAuth |

See `.env.example` for all variables with comments.

## Neon database + automated migrations

The app uses **PostgreSQL** in all environments; you switch dev vs production by **environment variables only** (see **[LOCAL-DEV.md](./LOCAL-DEV.md)**).

### What runs automatically

Every **`npm run build`** on Vercel runs:

`prisma generate` → **`prisma migrate deploy`** → `next build`

So **you do not need to SSH or run SQL by hand** for normal schema changes: commit migration files under `prisma/migrations/` (see below) and push — the next deploy applies pending migrations to the database configured in Vercel (`DATABASE_URL` + `DIRECT_URL`).

### One-time: Neon + Vercel env

1. Sign up at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) → create a project (e.g. **tutoring-notes**).
2. Copy into **Vercel → Environment variables** (Production):
   - **Pooled** connection string → `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Direct** connection string → `DIRECT_URL`
3. Deploy. The **first** deploy applies migration `prisma/migrations/*` and creates tables.

> **`DIRECT_URL`** is required so `prisma migrate deploy` can talk to Neon correctly. At runtime the app queries via **`DATABASE_URL`** (pooled).

### When you still do things manually

- **Emergency / broken CI:** run `npx prisma migrate deploy` locally with the same env vars, or use `scripts/push-schema-neon.ps1` / `db push` only as a fallback (documented in LOCAL-DEV).
- **Neon MCP / agents:** optional convenience; if tools hang or UAC appears, use the console + commands above instead.

### Preview deployments (PRs)

If Vercel **Preview** uses the **same** `DATABASE_URL` as Production, migrations from a branch can affect prod data. Safer: set a **separate** Neon branch + different env vars for **Preview**, or disable Preview DB access until you have that split.

### Troubleshooting: “relation already exists” / messy first migration

If you created tables earlier with `db push` or manual SQL, the first `migrate deploy` can error. Options: use a **fresh** Neon database for production, or follow [Prisma baselining](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/baselining) / `prisma migrate resolve` so the `_prisma_migrations` table matches reality.

## Email setup (Resend — recommended for pilots)

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com) → create an API key.
2. In the app admin settings (or via env), set:
   - `SMTP_HOST=smtp.resend.com`
   - `SMTP_PORT=465`
   - `SMTP_SECURE=true`
   - `SMTP_USER=resend`
   - `SMTP_PASS=<your Resend API key>`
   - `SMTP_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com` (must be a verified sender domain in Resend)
3. Send a test "Send update" from the app to confirm delivery.

Resend's free tier covers 3 000 emails/month — more than enough for early pilots.

## Password reset

Reset emails use the same SMTP/Gmail config as other emails. If email is not configured, the reset link will not be delivered — configure email before advertising this feature to users.

---

## First deploy checklist

1. Push repo to GitHub.
2. Import project in Vercel → set all environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_*`, etc.).
3. Deploy — **migrations run during the build** (`prisma migrate deploy`).
4. Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/setup` → create admin account (if none exists).
5. Go to `https://your-app.vercel.app/admin/settings/email` → configure email.
6. Send a test "Send update" to confirm email delivery.
7. Add OAuth **test users** (or complete Google verification) if using Connect Gmail — see `docs/pilot-ops-playbook.md`.

---

## Schema changes after launch

1. Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`.
2. Locally (with a dev DB): `npx prisma migrate dev --name describe_change` — creates a new folder under `prisma/migrations/`.
3. Commit and push. Vercel’s next build runs `migrate deploy` and applies pending migrations.

---

## Vercel + Neon re-deploy (iterating)

- Push to `main` → Vercel auto-deploys; pending migrations apply on build.
- If a migration fails, fix forward with a new migration or restore from backup — avoid editing already-applied migration SQL in git.
